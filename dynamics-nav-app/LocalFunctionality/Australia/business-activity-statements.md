title: Business Activity Statements
description: "A Business Activity Statement (BAS) is a form that businesses must submit to the Australian Tax Office (ATO) on a monthly or quarterly basis. BAS reports both the total Goods and Services Tax (GST) collected from sales activities—which must be paid to the ATO—and the total GST paid on purchases – which is claimed as an input tax credit."
