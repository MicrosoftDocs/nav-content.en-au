# <a name="how-to-correct-prepayments"></a>How to: Correct Prepayments
You can make a correction to an order after you have posted a prepayment invoice for the order. You can add new lines to an order after issuing a prepayment, and then you can post another prepayment invoice, but you cannot delete a line from an order after a prepayment has been invoiced for the line.  

## <a name="to-correct-a-prepayment"></a>To correct a prepayment
The following procedure shows how to issue a prepayment CR/Adj note to cancel all invoiced prepayments for a sales order.  
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant sales order.
3. Choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Credit Adjustment Note** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. CR/Adj Note. Memo** action.  
4. In the **Sales CR/Adj Note** window, proceed to correct the relevant entries, as for any sales CR/Adj note. For more information, see [How to: Process Sales Returns or Cancellations](sales-how-process-sales-returns-cancellations.md).     

    > [!NOTE]  
    > To Reduce the amount in the **Line Amount** field, you must first increase the prepayment percentage on the line so that the value in the **Prepmt. Line Amount** field is not decreased below the value in the **Prepmt. Amt. Inv.** field.

5. To make a prepayment invoice for any new lines in the sales CR/Adj note, choose the **Prepayment** action, and then choose the **Post Prepayment Invoice** action or the **Post and Print Prepmt. Invoice** action.  
6. To issue an additional prepayment invoice, increase the prepayment amount on one or more lines and post the prepayment invoice. A new invoice will be created for the difference between the prepayment amounts invoiced and the new prepayment amounts.
