# <a name="personalizing-your-workspace-in-the-dynamics-windows-client"></a>Personalising Your Workspace in the Dynamics Windows Client
You can personalise, or customise, your workspace to suit your work and preferences by changing pages so that they display only the information you need, where you need it. The personalisation changes that you make will only affect what you see, not what other users see. You can personalise many parts of the user interface (UI), including which actions to include on the ribbon, how fields are positioned on FastTabs or in FactBoxes, and which menu items to include in the navigation pane.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also personalise pages by using the [!INCLUDE[nav_web_md](includes/nav_web_md.md)]. To learn how personalisation works between the two clients, see [Personalisation Overview](ui-personalization-overview.md).

## <a name="how-to-personalize-your-workspace"></a>How to personalise your workspace
You perform most of the personalisation work by using the **Customise** feature, which you can access from practically all types of pages by doing the following:

1.  Open the page that you want to personalise.
2.  In the top left, choose the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](media/applicationmenuicon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon") icon, choose **Customise**, and then select one of the customisation options.

There are also some basic UI changes, such as adjusting the size of any window or expanding the width of columns, which you do directly on the page, outside of the **Customise** option.

## <a name="general-information"></a>General information
While customising the UI, it is a good idea to keep these points in mind:

-   You can record multiple customisations of the same page based on different access points to the page. For example, the Sales Orders window can be customised to look different when it is opened from the Customer Card window than when it is opened from the Sales Order Processor Role Centre. The point from which you access the page to be customised is recorded in that specific page customisation. Accordingly, there may be multiple page-customisation records in the database, as you can see in the **Delete User Personalisation** window.

-   The application can be configured to show and hide user interface (UI) elements (such as fields, FatTabs, and FactBoxes)lbased on your licence or permissions. You will only be able to view and customise elemnts fields that you have permission to.

## <a name="customize-ribbons"></a>Customise Ribbons
The ribbon provides you access to several actions. By customising the ribbon, you can optimise it for your work processes and preferences. For example, if you frequently use the **Dimensions** window, you can add the **Dimensions** action to the **Process** actions group. You can also remove actions that you never use for better overview.  

You can perform the following tasks to customise ribbons on pages:  

-   Add, rename, or remove tabs, groups, actions, and menus.  
-   Change the order of actions.  
-   Restore the ribbon to its default setting.  

### <a name="to-customize-a-ribbon"></a>To customise a ribbon
1. Open the page that you want to change.
2. In the top left, choose the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](media/applicationmenuicon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon") icon, choose **Customise** , and then **Customise Ribbon**.

The **Organise actions in the ribbon** dialogue box is divvided into two panes. The **Available actions** pane lists all the actions that you can choose to add to the page. The **Show actions in this order** pane shows the structure of all the actions currently shown on the page.

-   Root-level items define tabs.

    -   Second-level items define a group in a tab.

        -   Third-level item define a menu of actions in a group

### <a name="add-a-group"></a>Add a group
Select the tab under which you want the group, and then select **Create Group**. You cannot add a group under a menu.

### <a name="add-a-menu"></a>Add a menu
Select the group under which you want the menu, and then select **Create Menu**. You can only add a menu to a group or another menu.

#### <a name="add-an-action"></a>Add an action
Select it in the **Available actions** pane, choose **Add** to add it to the **Show actions in this order** pane, then use the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to place it where you want it.

You cannot add an action to a tab; only to a group or menu.

###  <a name="limitations-and-recommendations"></a>Limitations and recommendations
Be aware of the following limitations when you customise the ribbon:  

-   System tabs or groups such as **Home** or **New** cannot be moved or renamed. The position of some groups, such as **New Document** is fixed.  
-   Actions or groups that have dynamic visibility cannot be added or removed.
-   You can only create menus inside groups, not inside tabs.  
-   You can nest a menu within another menu, but this is not recommended.  
-   If you see unexpected behavior with groups and actions after having customised the ribbon, do the following:  

    1.  Empty, but do not delete, the group where the problem occurs.  
    2.  Close the dialogue using the **OK** button.  
    3.  Open the dialogue again and re-add the actions to the group.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Any customisation that alters the ribbon could affect the guidance provided in the [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] Help, because navigation steps in Help may refer to a different ribbon layout.

## <a name="customize-fasttabs"></a>Customise FastTabs
FastTabs help organise information about pages into simple, manageable groups. You can customise FastTabs on pages so that they support your workflow. For example, you may want to show fewer FastTabs or hide specific fields on FastTabs. You can also promote the most important fields to be included in the FastTab headers when the FastTabs are collapsed.  

### <a name="to-customize-a-fasttab"></a>To customise a FastTab  

1.  Open the page that you want to change.
2.  Choose the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](media/applicationmenuicon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon") icon, select **Customise**, and then choose **Customise This Page**.  
3.  In the **Customise <Page Name>** dialogue box, choose **FastTabs**.  

### <a name="add-move-or-remove-fasttabs"></a>Add, move, or remove FastTabs

-   If you want to display the field in the FastTab header when the FastTab is collapsed, set this to **Promoted**.
- If you want the field to be hidden unless the user chooses the **Show More Fields** action on the FastTab, set this to **Additional**.
-   **Standard** is the default or normal setting.

### <a name="set-up-field-for-quick-entry"></a>Set up field for Quick Entry

## <a name="customize-factboxes"></a>Customise FactBoxes
You use FactBoxes to see information that relates to the record that you have selected in the list or opened in a task page. You can select which FactBoxes to display in your FactBox pane. You can also customise FactBoxes to display only the fields that you need.  

### <a name="to-show-or-hide-the-factbox-pane"></a>To show or hide the FactBox pane
FactBoxes are contained in a FactBox pane, which you can choose to show or hide on a page basis. This enables you to easliy hide multiple FactBoxes without having to remove them individually.

### <a name="to-set-the-freeze-pane"></a>To set the freeze pane
A list can have many columns, which can force you to scroll horizontally to see all the columns. There might be some columns that you always want to display even as you scroll. To achieve this, you can add a vertical freeze pane to restrict some columns from scrolling. This enables you to ensure that only less important columns move when you scroll.

To set the freeze pane, select the column after which you want the freeze pane to start, and then choose **Add Freeze Pane**.

## <a name="adding-charts-to-role-centers-and-list-pages"></a>Adding Charts to Role Centres and List Pages
When you have complex information, you may want to view a visual representation of the data to help see trends and make decisions. For example, you may want to monitor the balances per bank account for your company in a chart. You use the chart pane to visually show data from a list on the following types of pages:  

-   On your Role Centre, where you can select from predefined generic charts.
