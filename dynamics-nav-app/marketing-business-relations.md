# <a name="set-up-business-relations-on-contact-companies"></a>Set Up Business Relations on Contact Companies
You can use business relations to indicate the business relationship you have with your contacts, for example, a prospect, bank, consultant, service supplier, and so on.

Using business relations on contacts is a two-step process. First, you define the business relation code. You only have to perform this step one time for each business relation. Once you have a business relation code, you can start to assign the code to contact companies.

**Note**: If you plan to synchronise your contacts with vendors, customers, or bank accounts in other parts of the application, you may want to set up a business relation for them.

## <a name="define-a-business-relation-code"></a>Define a Business Relation Code
The business relation code defines a category or type of the business relationship, such as BANK or LAW. You can have several business relation codes. To define the business relation, you use the **Business Relations** window.

1. In the top right corner, choose the **Search for Page or Report** icon, enter **Business Relations**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **New** action, and fill in a code and description. The code can be a maximum of 11 characters, and can be any combination of numbers and letters.

## <a name="assign-business-relations-to-a-contact"></a>Assign Business Relations to a Contact
You cannot assign business relations to a contact person - only companies.

1. Open the contact.
2. Choose the **Company** action, and then the **Business Relations** action.

    The **Contact Business Relations** window opens.
3. In the **Business Relation Code** field, select the business relation you want to assign.

Repeat these steps to assign as many business relations as you want. You can also assign business relations from the contact list by following the same procedure.

The number of business relations you have assigned to the contact is displayed in the **No. of Business Relations** field in the **Segmentation** section in the **Contact** window.

After you have assigned business relations to your contacts, you can use this information to select contacts for your segments. For more information, see [How to: Add Contacts to Segments](marketing-add-contact-segment.md).
